## Professional Experience

### Sony Music Entertainment * October 2010 to Present  
Chicago, IL & New York, NY  
Director of Software Development

With the successful launch of the Ariama classical music store, I joined Sony Music as a permanent employee.  My position has been both as a direct manager of developers and as a project manager on various projects within the Sony Music Direct-to-Consumer group.

* Artist Website Platform Engineering.  I manage this team tasked with building and maintaining the code base on which all Sony recording artists’ sites are built.  This platform runs on the Drupal CMS system.  My role managing this team requires me to work with other groups within Sony to vet new features before pitching to clients, create requirements and user stories, set development priorities, and help the engineers execute by removing any impediments they encouter.

* Core API Platform Engineering. Key to the future of the Direct-to-Consumer group is being able to provide a suite of core differentiating services to our clients.  Many of the services that make our offering unique are currently encapsulated in the Drupal CMS platform. My platform engineering team has been asked to begin extracting those services into an agnostic platform that can service any of our clients’ sites using API best-practices.  Along with the product managers, I decide which services to build, gather requirements, and create user stories.  I am also responsible for setting priorities for the engineering team and smoothing the way for implementation of these APIs.

* Ariama Store.  I continue to manage the software development for Ariama.  We are just beginning an overhaul of the site design and implementation of some much needed back-end maintenance to upgrade and update the site.  The Direct-to-Consumer group leadership sees an opportunity to make inroads on a niche, genre-based market with Ariama as the first such store. I work with the Ariama product management team to decide feature requirements and priorities, and I either implement the functionality myself or work with a set of available contractors to do the implementation.

* Agility and Lean Evangelism. As an evangelist for agile development, I work closely with our newly created product management team to spread agile practices to other development teams within the Sony Music Direct-to-Consumer group.  I consult with development teams on day-to-day questions with their processes and help them understand how to be more agile.  We have also recently begun applying some lean business principles to the group’s activities, and I have advised on the best way to approach implementing those.

* “The X Factor USA”.  The Direct-to-Consumer group has begun soliciting clients outside the Sony Music corporate sphere.  One recent client we took on was Fox Television’s talent show “The X Factor USA.”  I ran this project for the 5 months prior to the program’s airing and for the 3 month period it ran live on the air.  I managed both the mobile and website software development.  My involvement was very hands-on with co-located and remote development teams.  I worked with Sony and Fox product teams to define new features, turned those into actionable user stories, and monitored the progress on those stories closely.  We successfully completed this project in December 2011.

### Independent Consultant * February 2009 to October 2010
Chicago, IL  
Development and Project Management Consulting

With the closure of TotalMusic, I began working on independent consulting projects primarily associated with the digital music space.  My duties on these projects have encompassed system architecture, software development, project management, and business analysis.

* I managed the Ariama project for Sony Music Entertainment.  Ariama was an online classical music store selling high quality digital music files and presenting classical-centric metadata in a unique manner.

* I designed and built the content processing system and other systems that support Ariama’s operations.  This includes metadata cleanup and normalization systems, media transcoding, data warehouse operations, and sales reporting.

* As a content management system expert, I consulted with LimeWire LLC in their due diligence process considering the purchase of one of their competitors.


### TotalMusic LLC * February 2008 to February 2009
Herndon, VA  
Director of Software Engineering


TotalMusic was an API-based music platform providing music file delivery, user-generated content storage and sharing, and a music download store.

* I managed a team of 14 engineers and technical staff building all facets of our platform.

* Additionally, I functioned as the Scrum Master, and our use of Scrum development methods was successful in delivering functioning software.

* As part of the development team, I worked with other engineers to design the internal systems and the APIs to access those systems.

* Working with the QA team, I prioritized and filtered bugs for the development staff.

* Our operations team worked closely with the development team, and I helped operations personnel make sure the deployed hardware and software systems were adequate to meet the needs of the software we were building.

* Managing the team included doing annual reviews, negotiating salaries, holding weekly one-on-one meetings, mentoring junior engineers, and participating in decisions on staff reductions.

### Independent Online Digital Alliance (IODA) * May 2007 to February 2008
San Francisco, CA  
Software Engineering Manager

IODA is a digital media company providing content distribution and accounting services to independent record labels.  They encode and deliver digital music and video to all major online music services, including iTunes, eMusic, and Rhapsody.

* I managed a team of seven engineers responsible for all systems engineering tasks including content ingestion, media file transcoding, media file delivery, and royalty accounting.

* I consulted on all design decisions regarding systems built by my team, and mentored junior engineers as they worked on the systems we built and maintained.

* I increased inter-department communication by helping software engineers to trust other groups to handle day-to-day operational duties.  When I arrived at IODA, the engineering staff was primarily responsible for running many of the systems they were building.  In order to improve development efficiency, I worked with the developers to transition these duties to operational groups within the company.

* Successfully delivered on several Scrum sprints.  IODA uses Scrum as a development process, and as a Certified Scrum Master, I was able to help the team focus on stories in the current sprint (development cycle) and avoid the outside distractions that cause development delays and undue team stress.

* Laid out design goals promising increased operational efficiency, allowing the company to increase content throughput without adding staff.  Many of the deployed systems are labor intensive or overwhelmed by the amount of content flowing through them.  I worked with the engineering staff to identify areas where these systems could be refactored and improved.

### AOL Music Now (formerly FullAudio/MusicNow) * January 2000 to April 2007
Chicago, IL  
Manager Of Music Service Development

The Music Now division of AOL was a subscription-centric music service providing over three million music tracks to our  500,000 paying subscribers.  Our service also had a purchase component, much like Apple iTunes, which allowed our two million shopper members to purchase music and videos.

* I increased the speed with which new software was developed and released to production by introducing agile methodologies to the service development team.  Prior to introducing agility, development cycles were running as long as 12 weeks or more.  Once we began using the agile techniques I introduced, the development cycles were reduced to three weeks.  This allowed quicker release of high priority features and fixes.

* Introducing this agile development process saved on development staff attrition.  Prior to introducing agility, the developers were frustrated by the project management process then in place.  I learned through informal discussions that the most senior and knowledgeable engineers were beginning to explore other opportunities.  The promise of a new development methodology kept the staff together and improved overall morale.

* I designed and built a system that decreased storage costs by 50%.  We were contractually required to distribute our music files with anti-piracy technology attached to each file.  This required us to have multiple copies of each file in our storage system, one copy with anti-piracy and another without.  The system I created attached the anti-piracy wrapper on request whenever a user purchased a song or video.  By handling distribution this way, we only needed a single copy of the file and were able to reclaim half of our SAN storage.

* I enabled our content team to increase the ingestion speed of new content into our music service by creating a content processing system .  At our peak in January, 2007, we were able to make over 70,000 new songs per week available to our members using this system.

* We were contractually obligated to pay royalties for all music and videos sold.  I designed and built a system according to these contract terms, decreasing our risk of making incorrect or late royalty payments.

* I designed all data structures for all database-centric projects I worked on.  I understand relational database concepts and am familiar with standard DDL used to build and manage relational databases.
