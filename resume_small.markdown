## About Me 

* I believe in diversity in tech, so I volunteer with [Railsbridge NYC](http://railsbridgenyc.org).  
* Some books that have influenced me: _Lean From The Trenches_ by Henrik Kniberg, _Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby_ by Sandi Metz, and _The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy_ by Douglas Adams &mdash; naturally.  
* I'm a [Certified Scrum Master](http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/14331-troy-denkinger).  
* While I did study philosophy, please don't talk Plato with me as I'm sure I have forgotten most of it.
